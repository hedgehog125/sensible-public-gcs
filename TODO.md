Send a response instead of a redirect when the object is small? Otherwise it could be requested many times in the 10 seconds
Assume each signed URL will be used 100 times and have that assumed usage accumulate until disproven by overall usage a while after. Start proxying when a request would otherwise the total assumed usage to go over a limit (90GB?). Only count each request as the size of the object but can be partly refunded if the later overall usage disproves it
Are client aborts proxied correctly?
