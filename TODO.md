* Upgrade Go
* Use chan x instead of *chan x?

# Unimportant
 * Allow concurrent reads if there are no writes
 * Scan for available ports during tests to allow concurrency

# Tests

## Basic Endpoints

## Mock Systems
 * Create signed URL
 * Get GCS egress

## Sequences
 * Is the egress reset after a 'day'? Can the user then hit the limit again?
 * Multiple simultanious users?
